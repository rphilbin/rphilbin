Hi, I’m @rphilbin
I’m interested in data science as it applies to appropriate technology.
I’m currently refreshing my knowledge of python and MySQL, but am an expert in R and general statistical analysis.
My passion is appropriate technology, especially as it relates to energy use and human-powered transportation.
